### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ I'm Jett

For whatever reason that brought you here, welcome to my blog. I hope you're having a decent day.

I was a senior frontend engineer at [MyShell](https://myshell.ai) over the past few years.

I'm seeking for a frontend engineer job right now.

- ðŸŒ± I'm striving to become a web3 full-stack frontend engineer every single day, in the meantime I'm learning Node.js and Solidity.
- ðŸ¥˜ I'm cooking up some content and building a new portfolio.
